> 
- Getting around Taipei is super convenient with its efficient public transport system.
- MRT (Mass Rapid Transit): The best way to travel! Clean, fast, and cheap. Most attractions are near MRT stations.
- Buses: Good for short trips, but can be confusing for non-locals. Use Google Maps for navigation.
- YouBike (Bike Sharing): Great for short rides around the city. You need an EasyCard to rent one.
- Taxis/Uber: Affordable. Taxis are metered, and Uber works well.
- High-Speed Rail (HSR): If you want to travel outside Taipei (e.g., Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung), the HSR is the fastest option.

## Payment Methods

In Taiwan, cash is still the most commonly used payment method, especially at traditional markets, street vendors, local eateries, and some taxis. However, credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) are widely accepted at department stores, chain retailers, hotels, and larger restaurants.

Mobile payments are also becoming increasingly popular. Common apps include LINE Pay, JKOPay (Ë°óÂè£ÊîØ‰ªò), Apple Pay, and QR code payments supported by major local banks.

Note: Some of these services may only work with local bank accounts, so it‚Äôs a good idea to carry some cash just in case.
