- Getting around Taipei is super convenient with its efficient public transport system.
- MRT (Mass Rapid Transit): The best way to travel! Clean, fast, and cheap. Most attractions are near MRT stations.
- Buses: Good for short trips, but can be confusing for non-locals. Use Google Maps for navigation.
- YouBike (Bike Sharing): Great for short rides around the city. You need an EasyCard to rent one.
- Taxis/Uber: Affordable. Taxis are metered, and Uber works well.
- High-Speed Rail (HSR): If you want to travel outside Taipei (e.g., Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung), the HSR is the fastest option.
